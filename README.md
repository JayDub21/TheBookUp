## The problem

There is a huge discrepancy between the price of new textbooks and the amount that students can resell them for. The BookUp is an app that allows students to put used textbooks up for sale to be bought by others who need the textbooks.

## Market Analysis

There exists multiple forums for buying and selling used textbooks. Currently the competitors are BookScouter, CampusBooks, Chegg, Craigslist and Facebook Marketplace. Our platform provides users with peer-to-peer messaging and up-to-date prices on books to facilitate price negotiation and allow buyers to make educated decisions. The BookUp app will be more user-friendly and aesthetically engaging than the Craigslist or FB Marketplace forums to drive usage. The app will also feature a mobile-first design, which appeals to the college-aged demographic.
